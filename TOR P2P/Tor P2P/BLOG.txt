    - Fake-node-list attack :
        Description : A mal-node provides a fake node list to requester or responser to attack TORP2P network.
        Solution    :
            1. Random verify :
                Verifying the node list from remote randomly to check if it provides a fake node list.
                The method of verifying is to check the public key of a singel node, if the public key
                is from the node, then a node from remote node list is recognized ok, otherwise it is
                recogonized bad. If the node to verifying doesn't request verify request, then skip it
                and go check the next node. If there is a bad node (has response, but public key doesn't
                mathed), the remote node is recognized a mal-node, and the local node will delete the
                mal-node address from it's node list and will not accept the remote node list.

                With this solution, the mal-node cannot determine which nodes in the list it provided the
                victim node will verify, so the mal-node will not want to add too many fake node in its
                node list.

                The default munbers of nodes to verify is 7 (if total number is lesser then 7, then take
                two third nodes), it has probability of 0.78125% (1 / 2 ^ 7) to be attacked by the mal-node.

            2. Local-list first policy :
                When the node list passed the verification and the local node is going the accept the nodes
                list, each node will trust its own list if the two lists have the same key (node address) but
                differant information.
